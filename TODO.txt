TODO
====

* unlimited occurences are still possible with ical export, since there is no
  check on validity of the rrulestr itself. count/until limitations are done in
  recurrence_sequence_ical method, but until/count limitations are not set in
  rrulestr

* implement RFC2445 event types (event, todo, journal, freebusy) as interfaces which content types may provide

* fill in IEvent interface

* create adapters which serialize events to iCal format corresponding to their RFC2445 type (event, todo, journal, freebusy)

    * add more tests
    * make sure we have all event fields included into iCal
    * check how and where we should perform localization of dates

    * test recurrence ical export

* fix timezone tests (need to evaluate what function to use: pydt or DT2dt)

* utils.txt: guesstz + pydt tests

* check docstrings for validity

* make MAXCOUNT ceiling for occurences configurable. maybe via plone..

* is it ok to convert timezone naive dates to UTC? guess so.

OK * remove handling of timezone naive dates. timezone naivety simply doesn't
  exist. even sylvester is bound to timezones.

- Ensure compatibility with Archetypes based ATEvent and Dexterity based content DXEvent.
