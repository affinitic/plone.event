TODO
====

- implement RFC2445 event types (event, todo, journal, freebusy) as interfaces which content types may provide

- create adapters which serialize events to iCal format corresponding to their RFC2445 type (event, todo, journal, freebusy)

* utils.txt: guesstz + pydt tests

* check docstrings for validity

* is it ok to convert timezone naive dates to UTC? guess so.

OK * remove handling of timezone naive dates. timezone naivety simply doesn't
  exist. even sylvester is bound to timezones.
