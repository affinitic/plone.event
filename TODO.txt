TODO
====

* implement RFC2445 event types (event, todo, journal, freebusy) as interfaces which content types may provide

* create adapters which serialize events to iCal format corresponding to their RFC2445 type (event, todo, journal, freebusy)

    * add tests
    * make sure we have all event fields included into iCal 
    * check if we need extend iCal header with custom headers
    * ensure iCal is properly handling non-ascii chars and returning result in 'utf-8' encoding
    * check how and where we should perform localization of dates
    * 

* utils.txt: guesstz + pydt tests

* check docstrings for validity

* make MAXCOUNT ceiling for occurences configurable. maybe via plone..

* is it ok to convert timezone naive dates to UTC? guess so.

OK * remove handling of timezone naive dates. timezone naivety simply doesn't
  exist. even sylvester is bound to timezones.

- Ensure compatibility with Archetypes based ATEvent and Dexterity based content DXEvent.
