TODO
====

* implement RFC2445 event types (event, todo, journal, freebusy) as interfaces which content types may provide

* fill in IEvent interface

* fix timezone tests (need to evaluate what function to use: pydt or DT2dt)

* utils.txt: guesstz + pydt tests

* check docstrings for validity

* make MAXCOUNT ceiling for occurences configurable. maybe via plone..

* is it ok to convert timezone naive dates to UTC? guess so.

OK * remove handling of timezone naive dates. timezone naivety simply doesn't
  exist. even sylvester is bound to timezones.

- Ensure compatibility with Archetypes based ATEvent and Dexterity based content DXEvent.
